## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have a Stripe account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) here. Make sure you have created a Stripe API, with the least amount of permissions required to access the functionality of the Stripe Connector you plan to use. You can find more information about how to create an API key [here](https://stripe.com/docs/keys).

<ApiWarning />

## Setup

<StackCmd>

```shell
fctl payments connectors install stripe stripe.json
```

```shell
curl -X POST "https://$STACK.formance.cloud/api/payments/connectors/stripe" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d stripe.json
```

</StackCmd>

With stripe.json containing:

```json
{
    "name": "stripe",
    "apiKey": "<apiKey>",
    "pollingPeriod": "2m",
    "pageSize": 100
}
```
