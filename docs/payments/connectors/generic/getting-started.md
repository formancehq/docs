# Getting started with the Generic Connector

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Generic Connector to connect your Formance Stack with a fake Payment Service Provider that will return static fake data.

The generic connector interacts with a Payment Service Provider by sending requests formatted according to the [Generic Connector API specifications](api-reference) to an endpoint that you need to develop and provide. This endpoint acts as a middleware. It will query the Financial Institution and return the data in the expected format as shown in the diagram below.

```mermaid
graph LR
  Payments["Payments Core"]
  connector["Generic Connector"] 
  service["Integration Service"]
  psp["Payment Service Provider"]
  subgraph Formance Payments
    Payments <--> connector
  end
  subgraph Your insfrastucture
    connector <-- HTTP --> service
  end
  service <-- PSP specific protocol --> psp
```

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have a sandbox stack running. If you don't have one, you can create one by following the [Getting started with Formance](../../../getting-started/fctl-quick-start.mdx) guide.

## Setup

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use static data provided by a remote server created for this tutorial. The server is available at the following URL: `https://wo4o67kza53yyfxbqkxnpjkknm0mndbb.lambda-url.eu-west-1.on.aws`.

To install the Generic Connector, you need to create a `generic-connector.json` file that contains the configuration of the connector. The configuration file should look like this:

```json title='generic-connector.json'
{
    "name": "generic-tutorial",
    "apiKey": "fake-api-key",
    "endpoint": "https://wo4o67kza53yyfxbqkxnpjkknm0mndbb.lambda-url.eu-west-1.on.aws",
    "pollingPeriod": "1h"
}
```

Then, apply the configuration to your stack by running the following command:

```bash
fctl payments connectors install generic generic-connector.json
```

You should see a similar output:

```
You are about to install connector 'generic'.
Do you want to continue [Y/n]y
 SUCCESS  generic: connector 'eyJQcm92aWRlciI6IkdFTkVSSUMiLCJSZWZlcmVuY2UiOiI2NzI5YjI5NS00MGZmLTQzOWQtOTU1NS1mNTYwN2M2MzAzODUifQ' installed!
```

## Explore the data

Now that the connector is installed, you can explore the data that has been imported into Formance Payments.

First, open the console.

```bash
fctl ui
```

Navigate to the Payments page. You should see a list of payments that have been imported from the fake Payment Service Provider.

If you don't see any transactions but a welcome page, click on the `Refresh status` button to reload the data.

Congratulations! You have successfully imported payments data into Formance Payments using the Generic Connector.
