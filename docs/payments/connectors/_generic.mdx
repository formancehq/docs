## Prerequisites

Before you begin, if you want the Generic Connector to poll automatically your
data, you need to create a service on your side that will expose the data we need.
This service needs to follow this [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/formancehq/stack/blob/main/components/payments/cmd/connectors/internal/connectors/generic/client/generic-openapi.yaml).

When instanciating the generic connector, you will need to pass an API key that
will be used to authenticate the requests to your service. For now, the generic
connector will send requests with the api key in the Authorization header.

Example:

```
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```

<ApiWarning/>

## Setup

<StackCmd>

```shell
fctl payments connectors install generic generic.json
```

```shell
curl -X POST "https://$STACK.formance.cloud/api/payments/connectors/generic" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d @generic.json
```

</StackCmd>

With generic.json containing:

```json
{
    "name": "generic",
    "apiKey": "<apiKey>",
    "endpoint": "<endpoint>",
    "pollingPeriod": "2m"
}
```
