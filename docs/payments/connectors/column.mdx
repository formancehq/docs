## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have a Column account. [Column](https://column.com) is a modern banking-as-a-service platform that provides access to banking infrastructure through a simple API. Make sure you have a Column API key with the least amount of permissions required to access the functionality of the Column Connector you plan to use. You can find more information about how to create an API key in the [Column API documentation](https://column.com/docs/api/).

-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d @column.json
