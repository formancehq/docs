## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have a Atlar account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for a Atlar account](https://www.atlar.com/) here. Make sure you have a Atlar AccessKey, Secret and base URL, with the least amount of permissions required to access the functionality of the Atlar Connector you plan to use.

## Setup

<StackCmd>

```shell
fctl payments connectors install atlar atlar.json
```

```shell
curl -X POST "https://$STACK.formance.cloud/api/payments/connectors/atlar" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d @atlar.json
```

</StackCmd>

With atlar.json containing:

```json
