## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have a Atlar account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for a Atlar account](https://www.atlar.com/) here. Make sure you have a Atlar AccessKey, Secret and base URL, with the least amount of permissions required to access the functionality of the Atlar Connector you plan to use.

-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d @atlar.json
```

</StackCmd>
