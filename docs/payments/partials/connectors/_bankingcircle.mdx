### Client Certificate

You will also need a client certificate, along with the unecrypted key that you can extract from the pfx file you have assigned to your BankingCircle account. You can use the following commands to extract the certificate and the key from the pfx file:

```shell
openssl pkcs12 -in <filename.pfx> -clcerts -nokeys | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > client.cer
openssl pkcs12 -in <filename.pfx> -nocerts -nodes | sed -ne '/-BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-/,/-END PRIVATE KEY-/p' > client.key
```
