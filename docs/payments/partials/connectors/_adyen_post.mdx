Retrieve the connector ID after creation, you will need it to link the connector
to the webhook in Adyen.

Finally, you can add the URL in the server configuration in the webhook creation
page on Adyen. The URL must have the following format:

```
https://$STACK.formance.cloud/api/payments/connectors/webhooks/adyen/<connectorID>/
```

You can now save the configuration and wait for webhooks to start coming in.
