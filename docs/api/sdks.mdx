# SDKs

Beyond the HTTP API, you can use one of these libraries to communicate with a Numary instance:

If you're interested in creating an SDK, the latest OpenAPI spec can be found [here](https://api.numary.cloud/swagger.ledger.json) to generate types and requests.

We can offer sponsorship to community-owned SDKs, and are interested in both SDKs targeting specific languages and SDKs targeting application frameworks; feel free to ping @clem on the community discord anytime to discuss that topic.
