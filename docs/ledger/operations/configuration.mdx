# Configuration
Formance will attempt to read its config from file and environment variables - environment variables taking precedence over the config file.

## Config file

Generating the config file is straightforward:
```shell
numary config init

cd ~/.numary
cat numary.yml
```

## Environment variables

Any variable from the config file can be overwritten

```shell
NUMARY_STORAGE_DRIVER=postgres \
NUMARY_STORAGE_POSTGRES_CONN_STRING=postgresql://localhost/dbname \
numary server start
```
