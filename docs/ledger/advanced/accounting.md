# Accounting model

This section presents the Formance Ledger accounting model.

The Formance Ledger does not use a classical double-entry accounting model. Instead, it uses the source-destination model, which offer several advantages over the classical model.

First, we will describe what is an accounting model. Then we will present the source-destination model and its advantages. Finally, we will see how you can translate a double-entry accounting model into a source-destination model and how to implement common use cases.
