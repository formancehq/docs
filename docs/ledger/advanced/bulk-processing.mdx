title: Bulk processing
---

The `_bulk` endpoint allows for efficient processing of multiple requests in a single operation. It supports streaming, parallel or sequential processing, and atomic execution.

## Streaming support

Bulk requests can be streamed, enabling the efficient processing of large payloads without requiring the entire request to be loaded into memory.

To enable streaming, include one of the following content type headers in your HTTP request:

- For a script stream, include content type `application/vnd.formance.ledger.api.v2.bulk+script-stream`
- For a JSON stream, include content type `application/vnd.formance.ledger.api.v2.bulk+json-stream`

For a JSON stream, elements should be sent one per line in the request body. Example:

```
{"action": "CREATE_TRANSACTION", "data": {"postings": [{"source": "world", "amount": 100, "asset": "USD", "destination": "bank"}]}}
{"action": "CREATE_TRANSACTION", "data": {"postings": [{"source": "world", "amount": 200, "asset": "USD", "destination": "bank"}]}}
```

## Parallel vs. Sequential Processing

Bulk elements can be processed either in parallel or sequentially, controlled by the `parallel` query parameter:

- `parallel=true`: Elements are processed in parallel, improving throughput.
- `parallel=false`: Elements are processed sequentially, maintaining order.

## Atomic Bulk Execution

Bulk elements can be committed atomically or independently using the `atomic` query parameter:

- `atomic=true`: The entire batch is committed as a single transaction. If any element fails, the entire batch is rolled back.
- `atomic=false`: Each element is processed independently. If one element fails, it does not affect the others.

## Usage Example

To send a bulk request with parallel processing enabled and atomic execution disabled, use the following `curl` command:

```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(fctl cloud generate-personal-token)" \
     -X POST <stack-url>/api/ledger/v2/<ledger-name>/_bulk?parallel=true&atomic=false \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.formance.ledger.api.v2.bulk+script-stream' \
     --data-binary @<stream file location>
