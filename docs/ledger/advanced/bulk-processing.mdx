title: Bulk processing
---

The `_bulk` endpoint allows for efficient processing of multiple requests in a single operation. It supports streaming, parallel or sequential processing, and atomic execution.

## Streaming support

Bulk requests can be streamed, enabling the efficient processing of large payloads without requiring the entire request to be loaded into memory.

To enable streaming, use the `application/vnd.formance.ledger.api.v2.bulk+script-stream` content type.

## Parallel vs. Sequential Processing

Bulk elements can be processed either in parallel or sequentially, controlled by the `parallel` query parameter:

- `parallel=true`: Elements are processed in parallel, improving throughput.
- `parallel=false`: Elements are processed sequentially, maintaining order.

## Atomic Bulk Execution

Bulk elements can be committed atomically or independently using the `atomic` query parameter:

- `atomic=true`: The entire batch is committed as a single transaction. If any element fails, the entire batch is rolled back.
- `atomic=false`: Each element is processed independently. If one element fails, it does not affect the others.

## Usage Example

To send a bulk request with parallel processing enabled and atomic execution disabled, use the following `curl` command:

```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(fctl cloud generate-personal-token)" \
     -X POST <stack-url>/api/ledger/v2/<ledger-name>/_bulk?parallel=true&atomic=false \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.formance.ledger.api.v2.bulk+script-stream' \
     --data-binary @<stream file location>
