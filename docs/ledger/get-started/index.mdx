Are you building an app that requires tracking the movement of money? Then you need a ledger. Formance Ledger is designed to simplify the process of integrating ledger functionality into your app or backend.

Here, we'll help you get started with setting up Formance Ledger and executing your first transactions.

If you've never used Formance Ledger before, then start by [installing the Formance CLI](../../getting-started/fctl-quick-start.mdx), and run through the [Hello World guide](../get-started/hello-world/index.mdx) to create your first transaction using Numscript.

Then, once you're comfortable with the basics, move on to the [guides to Numscript](../numscript/_category_.yml) to learn about the different use cases and functionality that Numscript and Formance Ledger support.
