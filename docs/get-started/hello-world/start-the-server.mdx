# Start the Numary Ledger service

Numary Ledger is a service that must be running before it can process any transactions.

To start the Numary Ledger service, enter the following into your command line:

```shell
numary server start --debug
```

Normally, you wouldn't need the `--debug` option, but for learning it can be helpful to see some verbose logging of what's going on. Without this option, Numary Ledger is generally silent.

Anway, if all is well, you will see a great deal of debugging output in your shell that ends like this:

```
...
[Fx] HOOK OnStart       github.com/numary/ledger/cmd.NewServerStart.func1.1.1() called by github.com/numary/ledger/cmd.NewServerStart.func1.1 ran successfully in 2.636896ms
[Fx] RUNNING
```

## Troubleshooting

Seeing something other than `RUNNING`? Or nothing at all?

If there is **no output**, make sure you included the `--debug` flag.

If you see this:
```shell
listen tcp 127.0.0.1:3068: bind: address already in use
```
then there is already an instance of Numary running.

If the numary server just exits without a message, then you are probably already running an instance of the server somewhere else, _and_ you left off the `--debug` flag.
