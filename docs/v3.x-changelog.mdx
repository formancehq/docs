**Release date:** February 10, 2025

### Ledger

#### Stateless Ledger Service

The Ledger service is now fully stateless and can operate with multiple replicas without requiring nodes synchronization.

#### Zero-Downtime Upgrades

Upgrades between versions now occur with zero downtime, ensuring a seamless transition and uninterrupted service.

#### New Numscript Interpreter

The new numscript interpreter is now available in experimental mode (numscript used to be bundled in the ledger, but is now a separate, standalone library: https://github.com/formancehq/numscript)

#### Configurable Feature Disabling at the Bucket Level

You can now disable specific features on a per-ledger basis at the bucket level, allowing for better optimization based on your usage patterns.

#### Enhanced Write Performance

Significant improvements have been made to write operations, resulting in a higher throughput of transactions per second.

#### Improved Read Performance
Most endpoints have been optimized for faster read operations, leading to a more responsive system overall.

#### Enhanced `_bulk` Endpoint

The `_bulk` endpoint has been significantly improved with three major capabilities:

**Streaming Support**

Bulk requests can now be streamed, allowing large payloads to be processed efficiently without requiring the entire request to be loaded into memory.

To enable streaming, use the `application/vnd.formance.ledger.api.v2.bulk+script-stream` content type.

**Parallel vs. Sequential Processing**

You can now specify whether bulk elements should be processed in parallel or sequentially using the parallel query parameter:

- `parallel=true`: Elements are processed in parallel, improving throughput.
- `parallel=false`: Elements are processed sequentially, maintaining order.

#### Atomic Bulk Execution

You can now decide whether bulk elements should be committed atomically using the atomic query parameter:

- `atomic=true`: The entire batch is committed as a single transaction. If any element fails, the entire batch is rolled back.
- `atomic=false`: Each element is processed independently. If one element fails, it does not affect the others.

Usage Example:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(fctl cloud generate-personal-token)" \ -X POST <stack-url>/api/ledger/v2/<ledger-name>/_bulk?parallel=true&atomic=false \ -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.formance.ledger.api.v2.bulk+script-stream' \ --data-binary @<stream file location>
```

These improvements provide greater flexibility and control over bulk processing, optimizing for performance, consistency, and reliability.

### Payments

#### New dependency: Temporal

Temporal is now required to deploy the Payments service.

#### New V3 API improvements

**New task endpoint**

Added an endpoint to fetch a task, which represents a background user operation. Once completed, the task will have a status of either "failed" or "successful." If successful, the ID of any created object can be retrieved from the task.

For connector uninstallation, payment initiation, and bank account creation, HTTP code 202 and a taskID are returned. The operations run in the background, and you can monitor their status and retrieve relevant IDs (e.g., payment or account ID) upon success by polling the task.
