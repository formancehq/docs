title: Welcome to The Formance Platform
---

import {DocCardGrid,DocCard} from '@site/src/components/DocCard';

Formance is an open-source and cloud native infrastructure platform to build financial applications. It enables software engineers to build and operate complex flow of funds, weaving together multiple financial partners and money movement rails on top of an agnostic infrastructure.

## What's a flow of funds?

A flow of funds is a sequence of financial transactions that move money from one place to another. Some transactions will interact with external payment rails, like credit cards or bank transfers. Others will be internal to your organization, like moving money between accounts in your ledger.

The purpose of the Formance Platform is to equip you as an engineer with a foundation to build and operate these flows of funds in a reliable, scalable, and secure way.
