title: Deployment

The agent allows linking your Kubernetes Cluster to your Formance Organization. To do this, you need to add an agent to your cluster that will manage the Operator through the CRDs.

## Requirements

Before you can link your Kubernetes cluster to a private Formance region. You must deploy [the Operator following this documentation](/next/operator/Installation).

Now that the Operator is deployed, we'll activate the agent that will communicate with Formance Cloud. The agent is a component that runs on your Kubernetes cluster and communicates with the Formance Cloud to manage the resources in your private region.

## Setup Agent

* `REGION_ID`
  * The private region identifier, as per given by fctl
* `REGION_SECRET`
  * The private region secret, as per given by fctl
* `REGION_URL`
  * The base URL you want to assign to your private region
  * The URL must begin with the http schema (eg: https://sandbox.formance.cloud)
  * Stacks created in this region will be assigned a subdomain in the form of `https://{organisationID}â€”{stackID}.{REGION_URL}`

:::info
Subdomains of `REGION_URL` will need to be publicly accessible in order to function properly with fctl and the Formance Cloud console.
:::

```yaml
# region.values.yaml
agent:
  enabled: true
  agent:
    id: "REGION_ID"
    baseUrl: "REGION_URL"
    authentication:
      clientID: "REGION_ID"
      clientSecret: "REGION_SECRET"

# As operator chart is also bundled by default with the agent chart, we can reuse the setup from the operator deployment
operator: 
  enabled: true
  operator-crds:
    create: false

```

With this file in place, we can deploy our private region using Helm:

```bash
helm upgrade --install regions oci://ghcr.io/formancehq/helm/regions \
--version v2.0.0-rc.30 \
--namespace formance-system \
--values region.values.yaml
```


### Check region availability

You can verify that the region is active by showing your private regions with the following command:

```bash
fctl cloud regions show REGION_ID
```

You should see the region marked as `active: yes`.

```
ID                                    | Name     | Base url                         | Active | Last ping               
dea0da54-0f58-4762-a3b8-6e60f2780140  | staging  | https://formance.example.com     | Yes    | 2024-05-07T09:21:07Z 
```
