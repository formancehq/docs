description: Learn how to setup a private region for Formance CloudPrem deployment
---

Every Formance resource deployed will belong to a stack, itself exising within a specific region. By creating a private region, we will provide a home for stacks that will be deployed on your own infrastructure.

Imagine being able to select `my-datacenter-1` instead of `eu-west-1` on AWS, and creating e.g. an EC2 instance there â€” to be deployed on your own machine, while still being managed by AWS. This is the essence of what private regions are about.

## Creating a region

The simplest way to create your private region is through fctl, issuing the following command:

```bash
fctl cloud regions create my_region

 > SUCCESS  Region created successfully with ID: 04d85b94-c045-45a35d-az5d6299d5bd
 > SUCCESS  Your secret is (keep it safe, we will not be able to give it to you again): 3c9aza0a-39c6-417a-8fce-c540da4bvb72
```

This will create a region within your organization, returning a region ID and a region secret in the process. You will need to keep these values at hand for the next steps.

You can inspect your newly created private regions with the following command:

```bash
fctl cloud regions show 04d85b94-c045-45a35d-az5d6299d5bd

# Information
ID        | 04d85b94-c045-45a35d-az5d6299d5bd
Name      | my_region
Base URL  | https://fincloud.plata.dev
Active:   | Yes
Public:   | No
Creator   | you@example.com
Last Ping | 2024-05-08T19:43:36Z
```

When an agent connects he will populate the following fields:
- Base url
- Active
- Last ping


## Summary

We have now created a private region, which will be used to deploy Formance CloudPrem. Now comes the time to link that region to an actual Kubernetes cluster, using the Formance Operator.
