<Warning/>
We are now reaching the final steps of this setup guide. We will now verify our setup by creating a stack in our Formance Cloud private region.

:::info
The Formance Platform seggregates resources first by region, then by stack. A stack is a deployment of the Formance Platform, isolated from other stacks. This allows you to have multiple deployments of the Formance Platform, for example for different customers or different environments.
:::

## Create a stack

```bash
fctl stack create foo
```

You will be prompted for the region in which you want to create the stack: you can select the private region we created earlier. As you confirm the command, this sequence of actions will be executed:

* The stack will be registered in the Formance Cloud control plane inventory
* The operator deployed in your cluster will receive the stack creation event
* The operator will create the stack namespace in your cluster
* The operator will deploy the stack in your cluster and all its components

After a few seconds or minutes, fctl will finally return and acknowledge the stack creation and availability.

## Enable/Disable stack modules

By default, a stack is composed of modules:

- Ledger
- Gateway
- Payments
- Auth
- Stargate

You can enable/disable any modules with:

```shell
fctl stack modules enable "orchestration"
fctl stack modules disable "orchestration"
```

# Obtain availables modules

Depending on the region you are using, you can obtain the list of available modules under `Capabilities > MODULE_LIST` with:

```shell
fctl cloud regions show c9abcd0df-480b-42c4-b5e7-dfght8e7c852                                                                                                                                      ─╯

```

## Checking our deployment

We should now see some resources in our cluster when filtering by namespace:

```
kubectl get all -n "<YOUR-FORMANCE-CLOUD-ORG-ID>-<YOUR-STACK-ID>"
```

## Using our stack

It is now time to finally use our stack. We will issue a simple command to query the ledger server infos in order to verify that our stack is working properly:

```bash
fctl ledger server-infos --stack="<YOUR-STACK-ID>"
```
