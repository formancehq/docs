title: Stack Deployment
---

Now that your Operator is ready to create stacks and Membership is also deployed, you can now deploy a stack on your cluster.

For this, you need to create a YAML file containing your Stack's information. Here is an example of a YAML file:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: formance.com/v1beta1
kind: Stack
metadata:
  name: ORGANIZATION_ID-demo
spec:
  versionsFromFile: v2.0
---
apiVersion: formance.com/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: ORGANIZATION_ID-demo
spec:
  stack: ORGANIZATION_ID-demo
---
apiVersion: formance.com/v1beta1
kind: Ledger
metadata:
  name: ORGANIZATION_ID-demo
spec:
  stack: ORGANIZATION_ID-demo
---
apiVersion: formance.com/v1beta1
kind: Auth
metadata:
  name: ORGANIZATION_ID-demo
spec:
  debug: true
  dev: true
  stack: ORGANIZATION_ID-demo
  enableScopes: true
  delegatedOIDCServer:
    clientID: stack_ORGANIZATION_ID_demo
    clientSecret: toto
    issuer: https://membership.DOMAIN.formance.dev/api
```

You can find all the information on the fields of this YAML file in the [Operator's documentation](/next/operator/Modules/Stack).

## Next steps
Now that your Stack has been correctly created, and the Console / Membership installation has been successful.
You can now communicate the Membership (for fctl) and Console URLs to your users.
