## Install the Licence using [Helm Global](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/subcharts_and_globals/#global-chart-values)

> All [Formance charts](https://github.com/formancehq/helm/) follows the same convention as described below.

Make sure to add your licence token and clusterID to the `values.yaml` file.

```yaml
global:
  licence:
    token: "your-token-here"
    clusterID: "your-cluster-id-here" # kubectl get ns kube-system -o jsonpath='{.metadata.uid}
...
```

Once installed you must see the following logs in any EE pod:

```bash
│ {"level":"info","msg":"Licence check started","time":"2025-02-20T10:17:22Z"}                                                                                                            │
│ {"level":"info","msg":"Licence check passed","time":"2025-02-20T10:17:22Z"}      
```

Any errors will be logged as well.

```bash
│ {"level":"error","msg":"Licence check failed: invalid token","time":"2025-02-20T10:25:22Z"}     
```
