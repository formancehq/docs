Numscript is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed to help you define complex financial transactions with easy-to-read, declarative scripts. 

Numscript allows you to:

- Define and execute financial transactions
- Transfer assets between accounts
- Set metadata on transactions and accounts
- Handle complex allocation scenarios
- Enforce constraints on transactions

The language prioritizes type safety, explicit account references, and deterministic execution to ensure financial operations are performed correctly and reliably.

## Program Structure

A Numscript program describes financial transactions as a series of `send` statements, each representing the transfer of assets (such as currency, tokens, or commodities) between accounts. These accounts can represent anything from bank accounts to vouchers, wallets, or pending orders.

A Numscript program typically includes:

- Statements: The core logic, mainly "send" statements for moving value.
- Variable Declarations: Optional, for reusable values.
- Metadata Statements: Optional, for adding metadata to accounts or transactions

## Example

Here is a Numscript transaction that moves funds through several accounts and splits the final amount:

```numscript
send [USD/2 599] (
  source = @world
  destination = @payments:001
)

send [USD/2 599] (
  source = @payments:001
  destination = @rides:0234
)

send [USD/2 599] (
  source = @rides:0234
  destination = {
    85% to @drivers:042
    remaining to {
      10% to @charity
      remaining to @platform:fees
    }
  }
)
```

This script describes a flow where money is introduced from the outside world, routed through payment and ride accounts, and then distributed between a driver, a charity, and platform fees. 

You can experiment with this script in the [Numscript playground](https://playground.numscript.org/?template=new) to see how the funds are routed and split.

## Selecting a Numscript interpreter

Since Ledger v2.2, two versions of the Numscript interpreter are available: the original, built directly into our Ledger service, and a new portable and embeddable interpreter that can run independently or enhance other ledgering systems.

The original interpreter is enabled by default but is no longer evolving, while the new version will receive ongoing updates and must be manually enabled.

To enable the new interpreter, enable the `ledger.experimental-features` and `ledger.experimental-numscript` [settings](../operator/Configuration%20reference/Settings).

Note that the [Numscript playground](https://playground.numscript.org/?template=new) uses the new interpreter, so results there may differ from those in production.
