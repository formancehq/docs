title: Destinations
---

In Numscript, a "destination" specifies where funds go in a financial transaction. Numscript provides flexible options for specifying destinations to accommodate various financial scenarios.

### Single destinations

The most basic destination is a direct reference to an account:

Syntax:

```numscript
destination = @destination_account
```

Example:

```numscript
send [COIN 100] (
  source = @world
  destination = @users:001
)
```

Account destinations can be specified using:
- Account references: `@account`
- Variables: `$account_variable`

### Allotment destinations

In addition to sequential accounts, destination blocks can use fractions or percentages to split the amount across multiple accounts. The summed total of fractions must equal 1, and the `remaining` keyword can be used to reach that total.

Syntax:

Using fractions: 

```numscript
destination = {
    fraction to destination_account1
    remaining to destination_account2
  }
```

Using percentages:

```numscript
destination = {
    percentage% to destination_account1
    remaining to destination_account2
  }
```

Examples:

With fraction allocation:

```numscript
send [COIN 100] (
  source = @world
  destination = {
    90/100 to @users:001
    remaining to @fees
  }
)
```
 
With percentage allocation:

```numscript
send [COIN 100] (
  source = @world
  destination = {
    90% to @users:001
    remaining to @fees
  }
)
```

### Kept destinations

Instead of transferring all funds to new accounts, you can specify that some portion should be "kept" (remain in the source account):

Syntax:

```numscript
destination = {
    destination = kept
  }
```

or

```numscript
destination = {
    fraction or percentage to destination_account1
    remaining kept
  }
```

Example:

```numscript
send [COIN 100] (
  source = @world
  destination = {
    50% to @users:001
    remaining kept
  }
)
```

This is useful when you only want to transfer a portion of the funds.

### Ordered destinations with maximum caps

Ordered destinations route funds to multiple destinations in sequence, with maximum caps for each destination:

Syntax:

```numscript
{
  destination = {
    max [value] to @destination_account1
    remaining to @destination_account2
  }
}
```

```numscript
send [COIN 100] (
  source = @world
  destination = {
    max [COIN 20] to @users:001
    max [COIN 50] to @users:002
    remaining to @users:003
  }
)
```

This sends up to the specified maximum to each destination in order, with any remaining amount going to the final destination.

### Nested destinations

You can nest destination structures to create complex distribution patterns:

Example:

```numscript
send [COIN 100] (
  source = @world
  destination = {
    80% to @users:001
    20% to {
      70% to @platform
      15% to @taxes
      remaining to @charity
    }
  }
)
```

In this example:
- 80% of the funds go to `@users:001`
- Of the remaining 20%:
  - 70% (14% of total) goes to `@platform`
  - 15% (3% of total) goes to `@taxes`
  - 15% (3% of total) goes to `@charity`
