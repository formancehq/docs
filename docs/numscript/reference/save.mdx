```numscript
// Prevent the end balance foo is never less than [USD/2 100]
save [USD/2 100] from @foo

send [USD/2 500] (
  source = {
    @foo
    @world
  }
  destination = @bar
)
```

In this transaction example, imagining the initial balance of `@foo` is `[USD/2 500]`, the end postings will be:

```json
[
  {
    "source": "foo",
    "destination": "bar",
    "amount": 400,
    "asset": "USD/2"
  },
  {
    "source": "world",
    "destination": "bar",
    "amount": 100,
    "asset": "USD/2"
  }
]
```
