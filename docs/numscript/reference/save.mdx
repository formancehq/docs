title: Save
---

The `save` statement in Numscript allows you to specify a minimum balance for an account, effectively preventing the account from going below a certain threshold during a transaction. This reserved amount is deducted from the available balance for subsequent operations within the same script.

## Syntax

The `save` statement has two main forms:

**Save a specific amount**:
```
save [ASSET AMOUNT] from @account
```

2. **Save all available balance**:
```
save [ASSET *] from @account
```

## Purpose

The `save` statement allows you to:
- Reserve funds in an account, preventing them from being used in subsequent transactions
- Implement minimum balance requirements
- Protect certain funds during multi-step financial operations

## Examples

### Basic usage

```numscript
// Prevent the end balance of @merchants:1234 from going below [USD/2 100]
save [USD/2 100] from @merchants:1234

send [USD/2 500] (
  source = @merchants:1234
  destination = @payouts:T1891G
)
```

In this example, if the account `@merchants:1234` has an initial balance of `[USD/2 500]`, the transaction will fail because the post-transaction balance would be `[USD/2 0]`, which is less than the saved amount `[USD/2 100]`.

### Using multiple sources

```numscript
// Prevent the end balance of @merchants:1234 from going below [USD/2 100]
save [USD/2 100] from @merchants:1234

send [USD/2 500] (
  source = {
    @merchants:1234
    @world
  }
  destination = @payouts:T1891G
)
```

This transaction results in the following transfers:

```json
[
  {
    "source": "merchants:1234",
    "destination": "payouts:T1891G",
    "amount": 400,
    "asset": "USD/2"
  },
  {
    "source": "world",
    "destination": "payouts:T1891G",
    "amount": 100,
    "asset": "USD/2"
  }
]
```

In this case, only `[USD/2 400]` is taken from `@merchants:1234` (instead of the full `[USD/2 500]`), with the remaining `[USD/2 100]` drawn from the `@world` account.

### Saving all available balance

```numscript
save [USD *] from @alice

send [USD 30] (
  source = {
    @alice
    @world
  }
  destination = @bob
)
```

This example reserves all USD from the `@alice` account, meaning none will be taken from that account during the transaction. All funds will come from `@world`.

### Using variables

```numscript
var $ass = USD
save [$ass 10] from @alice

send [$ass 30] (
  source = {
    @alice
    @world
  }
  destination = @bob
)
```

This examples uses a variable for the asset, where 10 units of the asset defined in `$ass` are saved from `@alice`.
