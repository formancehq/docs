title: Embedding
---

Numscript was originally built directly into our Ledger service. Now, it's portable and embeddable, meaning it can run on its own or enhance other ledgering systems.

The original interpreter is enabled by default but no longer evolving, while the new version is actively improving and must be manually enabled. 

To enable the new interpreter, enable the `ledger.experimental-features` and `ledger.experimental-numscript` [settings](../operator/Configuration%20reference/Settings).

Note that the [Numscript playground](https://playground.numscript.org/?template=simple-send) uses the new interpreter, so results there may differ from those in production.
