# Reconciliation

Reconciliation is a managed service that provides a way to reconcile transactions between external Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and the Formance Ledger. It is a tool that helps you keep track of the transactions that are happening in your system and ensures that the balances in your system are in sync with the balances in the PSPs.

## Use-cases

Reconciliation can be a great fit if you are building:
- A marketplace where you need to keep track of the transactions happening in your system
- A system that needs to keep track of the transactions happening in multiple PSPs
- A system with complex money flows spanning acorss multiple accounts, providers or countries.

## Documentation organization

The documentation is organized as follows:
- tutorials that guide you through the setup and usage of the Reconciliation service
- how-to guides that provide step-by-step instructions on how to solve specific problems
- reference documentation that provides detailed information about the Reconciliation service
- explanations and clarification on the concepts and terms used in the Reconciliation service, as well as design decision discussions.
