# Reconciliation

Reconciliation is a managed service that provides a way to reconcile transactions between external Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and the Formance Ledger. It is a tool that helps you keep track of the transactions that are happening in your system and ensures that the balances in your system are in sync with the balances in the PSPs.

## Use-cases

Reconciliation can be a great fit if you are building:
- A marketplace where you need to keep track of the transactions happening in your system
- A system that needs to keep track of the transactions happening in multiple PSPs
- A system with complex money flows spanning acorss multiple accounts, providers or countries.
