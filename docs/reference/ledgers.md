# Ledgers

Numary is a "multi-ledger" ledger. This just means that a single instance of Numary can hold as many separate ledgers as you want. All the resources (i.e. accounts, transactions, metadata) are scoped by ledger.

Ledgers are identified by name, and providing a ledger name in all of your calls to Numary is required. There is no default ledger.
