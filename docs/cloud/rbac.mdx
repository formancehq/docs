description: How to configure Formance Platform Role-Based Access Control
---
With Formance Cloud, you can manage access to your organization and stacks using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This allows you to control who can access your organization and stacks, and what they can do with them.

## Roles

### Organization

- An organization's `ADMIN` can manage the organization and its stacks. It overrides the stack role.
- `GUEST` of an organization can read the organization.

### Stacks

- `ADMIN` of a stack can manage the stack control plane and data plane.
- `GUEST` of a stack can read the stack control plane and data plane.

Notice that to access a stack the user **must** have a role set on the organization.

## Basics

- Organizations: An organization's role is to manage an organization and stacks.
- Stacks: A stack role intent to manage **one** stack. Any stack belongs to an organization and can inherit the organization's role.

### Inviting a user

When inviting a user to an organization, you can directly assign a role to the user. When the user accepts, he will be granted configured roles.

```sh
fctl cloud organizations invitations send <email> \
    --stack-claims '[{"id":"vnrw", "role":"ADMIN"}]' \
    --org-claim ADMIN 
```

You can get more information on the different planes on [Architecture](/stack/architecture) page.

### Default roles: fallback when user assigned role is not satisfied

Default roles are assigned at the organization level. You can modify defaults with the following command:

```shell
fctl cloud organization update <orgId> --name <name> --default-stack-role "ADMIN" --default-organization-role "GUEST"
```

Examples

1. A user can be a member of an organization with the role `ADMIN` and have the role `GUEST` in a stack. GUEST would be ignored, he would be granted of the role `ADMIN` in the stack.
2. Fallback roles are set to organization `GUEST` and stack `GUEST`
   1. A user with **no roles** and **no stack role** assigned. would have role `GUEST` and stack role `GUEST` assigned
   2. A user with a stack role `NONE` would have the role guest assigned
3. Fallback roles are set to organization `ADMIN` and stack `ADMIN`
    1. A user with **no roles** and **no stack role** assigned would have role `ADMIN` and stack role  `ADMIN`
    2. A user with a stack role `NONE` would have the role ADMIN assigned
    3. A user with a stack role `GUEST` would have the role ADMIN assigned
4. Fallback roles are set to organization `NONE` and stack `GUEST`
    1. A user with **no roles** and **no stack role** assigned would have role stack role `GUEST`. 
    2. A user with a stack role `NONE` would have the role `GUEST` assigned
    3. A user with a stack role `ADMIN` would have the role `ADMIN` assigned


## Data planes: Roles to scopes translation

| Organization  | Stack   |  Scopes |
|---|---|---|
|  ADMIN  | _  | Read & Write  |
|  GUEST  | ADMIN  | Read & Write  |
|  GUEST  | GUEST  | Read  |
|  GUEST  | NONE    | _  |
|  NONE   | NONE  | _  |
|  NONE   | undefined  | _  |

- Organization ADMIN: read & write on all services
- Stack ADMIN: read & write on all services
- Stack GUEST: read on all services
- Else: no accesses

## Manage Permissions with FCTL

### Access to an organization

#### Describe an organization

```shell
fctl cloud organizations describe <orgId>
```

#### Update an organization

```shell
fctl cloud organization update <orgId> --name <name> --default-stack-role "ADMIN" --default-organization-role "GUEST"
```

#### List organization user

```shell
fctl cloud organizations users list —organization <orgID>
```

#### Change organization user role

```shell
fctl cloud organizations users link <userId> —role GUEST —organization=<orgId>
```

#### Delete organization user

```shell
fctl cloud organizations users unlink <userId> —organization <orgId>
```

### Access to a stack

```shell
fctl stacks users link <stackId> <userId> —role  GUEST --organization <organizationId>
```

#### Delete stack user

```shell
fctl stacks users unlink <stackID> <userId> --organization <organizationId>
```

#### List stack user role

```shell
fctl stacks users list <stackID> --organization <organizationId>
