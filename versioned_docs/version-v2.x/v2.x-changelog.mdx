### Ledger

#### Stateless Ledger Service

The Ledger service is now fully stateless and can operate with multiple replicas without requiring nodes synchronization.

#### Zero-Downtime Upgrades

Upgrades between versions now occur with zero downtime, ensuring a seamless transition and uninterrupted service.

#### New Numscript Interpreter

The new numscript interpreter is now available in experimental mode (numscript used to be bundled in the ledger, but is now a separate, standalone library: https://github.com/formancehq/numscript)

#### Configurable Feature Disabling at the Bucket Level

You can now disable specific features on a per-ledger basis at the bucket level, allowing for better optimization based on your usage patterns.

#### Enhanced Write Performance

Significant improvements have been made to write operations, resulting in a higher throughput of transactions per second.

#### Improved Read Performance
Most endpoints have been optimized for faster read operations, leading to a more responsive system overall.

#### Enhanced `_bulk` Endpoint

The `_bulk` endpoint has been significantly improved with three major capabilities:

**Streaming Support**

Bulk requests can now be streamed, allowing large payloads to be processed efficiently without requiring the entire request to be loaded into memory.

To enable streaming, use the `application/vnd.formance.ledger.api.v2.bulk+script-stream` content type.

**Parallel vs. Sequential Processing**

You can now specify whether bulk elements should be processed in parallel or sequentially using the parallel query parameter:

- `parallel=true`: Elements are processed in parallel, improving throughput.
- `parallel=false`: Elements are processed sequentially, maintaining order.

#### Atomic Bulk Execution

You can now decide whether bulk elements should be committed atomically using the atomic query parameter:

- `atomic=true`: The entire batch is committed as a single transaction. If any element fails, the entire batch is rolled back.
- `atomic=false`: Each element is processed independently. If one element fails, it does not affect the others.

Usage Example:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(fctl cloud generate-personal-token)" \ -X POST <stack-url>/api/ledger/v2/<ledger-name>/_bulk?parallel=true&atomic=false \ -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.formance.ledger.api.v2.bulk+script-stream' \ --data-binary @<stream file location>
```

These improvements provide greater flexibility and control over bulk processing, optimizing for performance, consistency, and reliability.
