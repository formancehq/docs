### Ledger

#### Stateless Ledger Service

The Ledger service is now fully stateless and can operate with multiple replicas without requiring nodes synchronization.

#### Zero-Downtime Upgrades

Upgrades between versions now occur with zero downtime, ensuring a seamless transition and uninterrupted service.

#### New Numscript Interpreter

The new numscript interpreter is now available in experimental mode (numscript used to be bundled in the ledger, but is now a separate, standalone library: https://github.com/formancehq/numscript)

#### Configurable Feature Disabling at the Bucket Level

You can now disable specific features on a per-ledger basis at the bucket level, allowing for better optimization based on your usage patterns.

#### Enhanced Write Performance

Significant improvements have been made to write operations, resulting in a higher throughput of transactions per second.

#### Improved Read Performance
Most endpoints have been optimized for faster read operations, leading to a more responsive system overall.

#### Enhanced `_bulk` Endpoint

The `_bulk` endpoint now supports streaming, parallel processing, and atomic execution, providing greater flexibility and control over bulk processing, optimizing for performance, consistency, and reliability. For details, refer to [Bulk processing](./ledger/advanced/bulk-processing).
