## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have a Wise account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for a Wise account](https://wise.com/register/#/email) here. Make sure you have a Wise API key and secret, with the least amount of permissions required to access the functionality of the Wise Connector you plan to use. You can find more information about how to create an API key [here](https://api-docs.wise.com).
