## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have a Modulr account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for a Modulr account](https://www.modulrfinance.com/contact-us) here. Make sure you have a Modulr API key and secret, with the least amount of permissions required to access the functionality of the Modulr Connector you plan to use. You can find more information about how to create an API key [here](https://modulr.readme.io/docs/gaining-use-of-the-api)
