description: Available connectors for the Connectivity Service
---

The Connectivity Service provides a connector framework that allows you to integrate
with any payment provider. It pre-packages the integration logic for some of
the most popular payment providers, as per the table below, with the goal of
providing connectivity to as many local and specific payment providers as
possible.

You can also create your own custom connectors by implementing the
[Connector Framework](./framework.mdx) and taking inspiration
from the existing connectors in the Github
[repository](https://github.com/formancehq/stack/tree/main/components/payments/cmd/connectors/internal/connectors).

## Logic behind the connectors

When installing a connector on Formance Console or by using the API, you will be
able to configure a polling period that will default to 2 minutes if not
specified.

This polling period will be used to periodically poll the payment service
provider in order to fetch all the data we need: Payments, Accounts,
Transfer/Payouts statuses when you create your transfer initiation etc.

We are continuously working to enhance our platform and are actively exploring
options to support listening to the payments service provider instead of using
polling. Stay tuned for future updates and developments in this area.
