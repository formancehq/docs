## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have a Mangopay account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for a Mangopay account](https://mangopay.com/contact) here. Make sure you have a Mangopay clientID and API key, with the least amount of permissions required to access the functionality of the Mangopay Connector you plan to use.
