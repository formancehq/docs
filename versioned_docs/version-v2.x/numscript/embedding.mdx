title: Embedding
---

Historically, Numscript was being built in a tightly knit way to our Ledger service, an extensible system-of-record and querying layer for financial transactions.

The new revision of Numscript is this time designed with portability and embeddability in mind. While Numscript is natively embedded in our Ledger service, you can also now run Numscript separately or bolt it on top of your existing ledgering system as a way to improve its programmability.

The standalone Numscript codebase can be found [here](https://github.com/formancehq/numscript).
