We provide the Formance Ledger as ready-to-use Docker container images. You can install the latest version of the CLI using the latest tag or a specific version passing the appropriate tag.

You must have a database (PostgreSQL) available to launch the Ledger. 

```shell
docker run -p 3068:3068 \
--env POSTGRES_URI="postgresql://localhost/dbname" \
ghcr.io/formancehq/ledger:latest
```

Once the container is up and running, check that the server is indeed running by calling the /_info endpoint:

```shell
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:3068/_info
```
