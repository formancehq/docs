description: Setup the Formance SDK in you Golang project.

## Create a new project

Create a new project with the following command:

```bash
mkdir formance-go-demo
cd formance-go-demo
go mod init example/formance-go-demo
```

## Install the Formance SDK

Install the Formance SDK with the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/formancehq/formance-sdk-go/v3
```

:::info
The Formance API relies on OAuth 2.0 for authentication. 

For more information, see [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/).
:::

:::danger
In this demo, we will setup the Formance SDK with the client credentials grant type,  which requires a client ID and client secret. These are sensitive credentials that should not be exposed to the public.

If you're integrating the Formance SDK in a client-side application, you should should use an OAuth 2.0 flow that does not expose the client secret, such as the [authorization code grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/).

## Hello world from the Formance Ledger

Create a new file called `main.go` with the following content:

```go
package main

import(
	"github.com/formancehq/formance-sdk-go/v3/pkg/models/shared"
	formancesdkgo "github.com/formancehq/formance-sdk-go/v3"
	"context"
	"github.com/formancehq/formance-sdk-go/v3/pkg/models/operations"
	"log"
)

func main() {
    s := formancesdkgo.New(
    	formancesdkgo.WithServerURL("https://<YOUR_SERVER_URL_HERE>"),
        formancesdkgo.WithSecurity(shared.Security{
            ClientID: formancesdkgo.String("<YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE>"),
            ClientSecret: formancesdkgo.String("<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE>"),
        }),
    )

    ctx := context.Background()
    res, err := s.Ledger.V2.ListLedgers(ctx, operations.V2ListLedgersRequest{
        PageSize: formancesdkgo.Int64(100),
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    fmt.Println("response:", res.StatusCode)
}
```
:::info
You'll need the API endpoint and the credentials created during the [SDK's Getting Started](./index.mdx) guide. If you don't have them, you can create them by following the guide.
:::

## Run the project

Run the project with the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

You should see the version of the Formance Ledger printed to the console, for example:

```bash
2.1.0
```
