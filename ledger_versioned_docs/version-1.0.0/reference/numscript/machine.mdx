import { NumscriptBlock } from 'react-numscript-codeblock';

Numscript is a tiny language that helps you model complex financial transactions. It follows three design goals:

## Readability
The intent should aways stand out; a Numscript program should never be ambiguous and have multiple possible interpretations. Programs should and readable by both developers non-technical financial users, providing a shared, executable definition of money-movements.

## Correctness
Monetary computations should always yield correct results, avoiding common currency rounding issues and accidental money creation or destruction.

## Finiteness
Numscript programs should always terminate and terminate predictably.

Here is a simple transaction example. We use multiple `send`, which will result in a single transaction with multiple postings:
```shell
send [USD/2 599] (
  source = @world
  destination = @payments:001
)

send [USD/2 599] (
  source = @payments:001
  destination = @rides:0234
)

send [USD/2 599] (
  source = @rides:0234
  destination = {
    85% to @drivers:042
    remaining to {
      10% to @charity
      remaining to @platform:fees
    }
  }
)
```
